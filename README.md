# Gautam Bhetanabhotla

Hi! I'm a passionate software developer with experience in C, C++ and Python, and more. I am particularly interested in UI design and development.

## Tools and technologies

#### Programming tools and libraries
Qt, Flutter, Firebase, SQL, Mongo, React, Tailwind

#### Creative Tools
Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, Adobe After Effects, Figma, Canva

## Projects I'm a part of

### AnkiDroid
My first open source contribution. Fixed issues #18278, #18379 and #18247 with a [single pull request](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/pull/18430)

#### Network file system
Developed a network file system with [Mrudani](https://github.com/MrudaniPimpalkhare), [Anshul](https://github.com/anshulbhagwat), and [Bhavya](https://github.com/thebhavyaahuja) for a course project on operating systems and networks. The architecture consists of one naming server, multiple storage servers and multiple clients. Supports reading from, writing to, copying, and streaming audio files (done through `libao` and `mpv`). Also supports redundancy and backup.

#### Enhancing xv6
Made modifications to the base version of the xv6 operating system, including adding new system calls and scheduling policies. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/gautambhetanabhotla/enhanced-xv6).

#### Construction site activity monitor
Trained and deployed a machine learning application with [Sriyansh](https://github.com/SANS-Surya-o), [Kushal](https://github.com/kushkushal439) and [Anvith](https://github.com/anvithrajr) on the Qualcomm QIDK to analyze activity on a construction site and generate a semantic overview with regards to safety of the workers and the most developing areas of the site.

#### Shell from scratch
Built a shell in C with support for piping, redirection, logging and more.

#### Video maker web application
This is a web application built with Flask and styled with Bootstrap that lets you upload pictures and audio and lets you convert them into a video slideshow with background audio, letting you choose transitions between the pictures.

#### IoT-based patient monitoring
Built an analytics dashboard integrated with ThingSpeak for IoT-based patient health monitoring. We procured heart rate and ultrasonic among other sensors for deployment into a hospital environment, in order to monitor the health conditions of a patient. The microcontroller used was an ESP32 dev module.

#### TicTacToe
Built a game of TicTacToe in C that can be played over a network. Consists of a server and 2 clients that can choose a networking protocol to play the game over.

## What I'm Exploring Next

- Mastering machine learning through TensorFlow, NumPy and more.
- More web frameworks like Svelte.
- New programming languages, like Rust and NASM.

## Hobbies

I love playing volleyball, table tennis, and graphic design. I am part of my college fest's videography team and I have participated in shooting and editing videos for quite a lot of events. I am also the coordinator of my college's design club and a former member of the college's Music club and the Entrpreneurship cell. I also enjoy singing, dancing and playing the keyboard.
